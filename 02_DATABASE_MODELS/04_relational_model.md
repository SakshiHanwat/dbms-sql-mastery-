## Relational Model in DBMS

The Relational Model organizes data using tables (relations) consisting of rows and columns.

The relational model represents how data is stored and managed in Relational Databases where data is organized into tables, each known as a relation.
Each row of a table represents an entity or record and each column represents a particular attribute of that entity.
The relational model transforms conceptual designs from ER diagrams into implementable structures. These structures are used in relational database systems like Oracle SQL and MySQL.

Example: Consider a relation STUDENT with attributes ROLL_NO, NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE and AGE shown in the table.

## Key Terms in the Relational Model

**Attribute:** Attributes are the properties that define an entity. For example, ROLL_NO, NAME, ADDRESS etc.

**Relation Schema:** A relation schema defines the structure of the relation and represents the name of the relation with its attributes. For example, STUDENT (ROLL_NO, NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE and AGE) is the relation schema for STUDENT. If a schema has more than 1 relation it is called Relational Schema.

**Tuple:** A Tuple represents a row in a relation. Each tuple contains a set of attribute values that describe a particular entity. For example, (1, RAM, DELHI, 9455123451, 18) is a tuple in the STUDENT table.

**Relation Instance:** The set of tuples of a relation at a particular instance of time is called a relation instance. It can change whenever there is an insertion, deletion or update in the database.

**Degree:** The number of attributes in the relation is known as the degree of the relation. For example, The STUDENT relation has a degree of 5, as it has 5 attributes.

**Cardinality:** The number of tuples in a relation is known as cardinality. For example, The STUDENT relation defined above has cardinality 4.

**NULL Values:** The value which is not known or unavailable is called a NULL value. It is represented by NULL. For example, PHONE of STUDENT having ROLL_NO 4 is NULL.

## Types of Keys in the Relational Model

**Primary Key:** A Primary Key uniquely identifies each tuple in a relation. It must contain unique values and cannot have NULL values.

**Candidate Key:** A Candidate Key is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple in a relation.

**Super Key:** A Super Key is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple.

**Foreign Key:** A Foreign Key is an attribute in one relation that refers to the primary key of another relation.

**Composite Key:** A Composite Key is formed by combining two or more attributes to uniquely identify a tuple.

## Relational Model Notation

Relation schema R of degree n is denoted by by R(A1, A2, ...,An).
Uppercase letters Q, R, S denote relation names.
Lowercase letters q, r, s denote relation states.
Letters t, u, v denote tuples.
In general, the name of a relation schema such as STUDENT also indicates the current set of tuples in that relation.
An attribute A can be qualified with the relation name R to which it belongs by using the dot notation R.A for example, STUDENT.Name or STUDENT.Age.
An n-tuple t in a relation r(R) is represented as t = <v1, v2,..., vn> where vi is the value corresponding to the attribute Ai. The value vi for attribute Ai in tuple t can be accessed using t[Ai] or t.Ai.

## Characteristics of the Relational Model

Data Representation: Data is organized in tables (relations), with rows (tuples) representing records and columns (attributes) representing data fields.

Atomic Values: Each attribute in a table contains atomic values, meaning no multi-valued or nested data is allowed in a single cell.

Unique Keys: Every table has a primary key to uniquely identify each record, ensuring no duplicate rows.

Attribute Domain: Each attribute has a defined domain, specifying the valid data types and constraints for the values it can hold.

Data Independence: The model ensures logical and physical data independence, allowing changes in the database schema without affecting the application layer.

Relational Operations: Supports operations like selection, projection, join, union and intersection, enabling powerful data retrieval manipulation.

Data Consistency: Ensures data consistency through constraints, reducing redundancy and anomalies.

Set-Based Representation: Tables in the relational model are treated as sets and operations follow mathematical set theory principles.

## Constraints in Relational Model

While designing the Relational Model, we define some conditions which must hold for data present in the database are called Constraints. These constraints are checked before performing any operation (insertion, deletion and updation) in the database. If there is a violation of any of the constraints, the operation will fail.

### 1. Domain Constraints

Domain Constraints ensure that the value of each attribute A in a tuple must be an atomic value derived from its specified domain, dom(A). Domains are defined by the data types associated with the attributes. Common data types include:

Numeric types: Includes integers (short, regular and long) for whole numbers and real numbers (float, double-precision) for decimal values, allowing precise calculations.
Character types: Consists of fixed-length (CHAR) and variable-length (VARCHAR, TEXT) strings for storing text data of various sizes.
Boolean values: Stores true or false values, often used for flags or conditional checks in databases.
Specialized types: Includes types for date (DATE), time (TIME), timestamp (TIMESTAMP) and money (MONEY), used for precise handling of time-related and financial data.

### 2. Key Integrity

Every relation in the database should have at least one set of attributes that defines a tuple uniquely. Those set of attributes is called keys. e.g.; ROLL_NO in STUDENT is key.

It should be unique for all tuples.
It can’t have NULL values.

### 3. Referential Integrity Constraints

When one attribute of a relation can only take values from another attribute of the same relation or any other relation, it is called referential integrity.

**### Table: STUDENT

| ROLL_NO | NAME   | ADDRESS | PHONE      | AGE | BRANCH_CODE |   
| ------- | ------ | ------- | ---------- | --- | ----------- | 
| 1       | RAM    | DELHI   | 9455123451 | 18  | CS          |   
| 2       | RAMESH | GURGAON | 9652431543 | 18  | CS          |

| 4       | SURESH | DELHI   | NULL       | 18  | IT          |   

**### Table: BRANCH

| BRANCH_CODE | BRANCH_NAME                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| CS          | COMPUTER SCIENCE                          |
| IT          | INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY                    |
| ECE         | ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING |
| CV          | CIVIL ENGINEERING                         |

Explanation: BRANCH_CODE of STUDENT can only take the values which are present in BRANCH_CODE of BRANCH. STUDENT is the REFERENCING RELATION and BRANCH is the REFERENCED RELATION.

## Anomalies in the Relational Model

An anomaly is an irregularity or something which deviates from the expected or normal state.

Insertion Anomaly in Referencing Relation: We can’t insert a row in REFERENCING RELATION if referencing attribute’s value is not present in the referenced attribute value.

Deletion/Updation Anomaly in Referenced Relation: We can’t delete or update a row from REFERENCED RELATION if the value of REFERENCED ATTRIBUTE is used in the value of REFERENCING ATTRIBUTE.
